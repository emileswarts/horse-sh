# â™ž  Horse-sh Theme for Oh My ZSH!

![horse-sh-oh-my-zsh](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/horsesh/horsesh.png)

*A very minimal brown/red themed oh my zsh theme.*

**No git prompt, because it just slows the horse down.**

The components are: **user, box name, time, current working directory.**

Feed the horse with your commands and good luck.

## Installation:
  Like put the theme file in your oh-my-zsh themes folder, and update your ~/.zshrc file to use it.
